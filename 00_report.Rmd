## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


1.	Introduction

The twin transition—comprising digital transformation and sustainability—is a central pillar of the European Union’s industrial policy. While policy frameworks increasingly promote the alignment of digitalisation with environmental goals, the empirical evidence on whether digitally active firms are also more committed to green practices remains limited. Previous studies on the same dataset address sustainability in a broad sense, conflating environmental actions with social and governance dimensions. However, disentangling these components is essential for evidence-based policymaking.
This study aims to analyse the relationship between digital technology adoption and green sustainability practices among European SMEs, using microdata from the Flash Eurobarometer 486 (2020). Specifically, this study focuses on five environmentally oriented actions: eco-innovation, recycling, resource reduction, energy saving, and sustainable product development. By adapting the methodological approach of Horbach (2024) — but restricting the sustainability dimension to environmental actions — this work provide a more targeted assessment of how digitalisation aligns with ecological outcomes at the firm level.


2.	Methods

2.1 Data

The data used are thriven from the Flash Eurobarometer 486, a survey conducted among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in all EU Member States in February 2020. The sample includes firms across all industrial sectors, stratified by country, size, and industry. We restrict our analysis to the 27 EU countries and focus on firms with complete information on key variables.

Dependent Variables
Five binary indicators representing green sustainability practices are selected following Horbach's methods:

•	eco_innovation (Q19_5)
•	recycling (Q24_1)
•	resource_reduction (Q24_2)
•	energy_saving (Q24_3)
•	sustainable_products (Q24_4)

Each is coded as 1 if the company reports engaging in the respective activity, 0 otherwise. Additionally, a sustainability_index (range 0–5) is constructed by summing these five indicators, providing a count measure of environmental engagement.


Independent Variables

The main explanatory variables are six binary indicators of digital technology adoption:
•	AI (Q23_1)
•	Big data (Q23_5)
•	Cloud computing (Q23_2)
•	High-speed infrastructure (Q23_6)
•	Robotics (Q23_3)
•	Smart devices/sensors (Q23_4)

Each variable equals 1 if the firm reports using the technology.


Control Variables

Following Horbach, firm-level controls capturing economic, structural, and contextual characteristics, are included:

•	Export orientation (Q12B_1–3)
•	Family ownership (Q13_7)
•	Financial capacity (Q4A_7–8)
•	High-growth firm (Q5_1_4, Q5_2_4)
•	Industry location (Q8_4)
•	Founding year (before 2000) (Q1)
•	Skill shortage as sustainability barrier (Q26_4)
•	Firm size (number of employees) (Q2B)
•	Urban location (Q8_1)


2.2 Statistical Models

Two complementary models:

1.	Multivariate Probit: jointly models the probability of engaging in each green action, accounting for correlations between the binary outcomes

2.	Negative Binomial: models the sustainability index (0–5) using the same covariates, to account for overdispersion in the count data
