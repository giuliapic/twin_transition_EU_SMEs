# Twin Transition in European SMEs

This repository contains all materials related to the final project for the course *Multivariate Analysis for Social Scientists* at the University of Milan. The analysis investigates the relationship between digitalisation and environmental practices among European SMEs, using data from the Flash Eurobarometer 486 (2020).


# Data source:  
Flash Eurobarometer 486 (2020) â€“ https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7637 


#Analysis:

- Model: Multivariate Probit  
- Software: R    
- Dependent variables: five binary indicators of environmental practices  
- Main predictors: binary indicators of digital technology adoption  
- Controls: firm size, sector (NACE), family ownership, financial capacity, skill shortages, urban/industrial location, country dummies  

--> in the 01_variable file, all variables are recoded as factor to strenghten the probit analysis model.
All data transformations and modelling steps are documented in the scripts.
