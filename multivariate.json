  {"id":"beiseLeadMarketsRegulation2005","abstract":"Environmental regulations are often intended to stimulate the generation and adoption of eco-efficient innovations. An important argument in the public debate is also the creation of new markets for environmentally benign products, processes and services in other countries and the generation, as a result, of export opportunities for the pioneering country (lead markets). Research on lead markets has not, however, focused on environmental innovations to date. We therefore extend the lead market model to environmental innovations and take particular account of the peculiarities of such innovations, in particular, the public good character of environmental benefits and the role of regulations. This approach is applied to two case studies: wind energy and fuel-efficient passenger cars. In both cases, the innovation was initially adopted in one country. Other countries subsequently adopted the same innovation design favored by the lead market which, in turn, developed into a large exporter in the wind generation and car industries, respectively. We discuss the regulations employed and the reasons for the international success of the innovations induced by them. Our findings demonstrate that when supported by global demand or regulatory trends, strict regulation results in the creation of lead markets. Finally, we provide recommendations on how our model could be used for further research and in the development of a coordinated environmental and innovation policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Beise","given":"Marian"},{"family":"Rennings","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"beiseLeadMarketsRegulation2005","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.06.007","ISSN":"0921-8009","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,5]]},"page":"5-17","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Lead markets and regulation: a framework for analyzing the international diffusion of environmental innovations","title-short":"Lead markets and regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800904002599","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"caoUnveilingSocialEnvironmental2025","abstract":"In the context of the “dual-carbon” goal and the digital economy, exploring the impact of digital transformation on enterprises’ social and environmental responsibility is a key issue for achieving sustainable enterprise development and promoting high-quality economic development. This study empirically examines the impact of digital transformation on enterprises’ social and environmental responsibility and its mechanism. We achieved this through using instrumental variables and DID (Differences-in-Differences)models and selecting the data of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2008 to 2021. The study concludes that an enterprise’s digital transformation positively contributes to the fulfilment of corporate social responsibility. However, the digital transformation of the enterprise has a dampening effect on the fulfilment of the enterprise’s environmental responsibility. Additionally, this effect holds after a series of robustness tests. Further investigation shows that financial constraints have a positive moderating effect on enterprise digital transformation and corporate social responsibility(CSR) and a negative moderating effect on enterprise environmental responsibility. In addition, we found that the impact of enterprise digital transformation on CSR and environmental responsibility varies by firm type. The above studies provide valuable practical experiences for enterprises to achieve green and low-carbon development, reduce environmental pollution, and realize high-quality economic development as well as insight for enterprises and policy implementers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Biru"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tianli"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ang"},{"family":"Shang","given":"Yujie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jinghao"}],"citation-key":"caoUnveilingSocialEnvironmental2025","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0320064","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,14]]},"language":"en","page":"e0320064","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Unveiling the social and environmental benefits of digital transformation in corporations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0320064","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"delrioWhatDrivesEcoinnovators2016","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to provide a critical review of the literature on the econometric analyses of firm-level determinants to eco-innovation. The review reveals some gaps in knowledge. First, an integrated theoretical framework which merges the insights from different approaches is missing. Second, the influence of some variables is still unsettled (demand-pull and cost-savings), whereas others have hardly been included in previous analyses (internal and international factors). Third, studies on the drivers to eco-innovation versus general innovation are relatively scarce with respect to those on the drivers to eco-innovation in general. Fourth, analyses of the relevance of different determinants to eco-innovation for distinct eco-innovator and eco-innovation types have largely been missing. Fifth, studies on middle-income and developing countries are still scarce. Sixth, the econometric analyses have relied on microeconometric methods based on cross-section data (mostly logit and probit models), whereas the use of panel data is virtually absent. Seventh, detailed econometric analyses on the distinct drivers and barriers to eco-innovation in different sectors and regions have not been performed so far. Finally, whether the position of the firm in the value chain and the market structure influence the propensity to eco-innovate are largely unexplored topics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Río","given":"Pablo","non-dropping-particle":"del"},{"family":"Peñasco","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Romero-Jordán","given":"Desiderio"}],"citation-key":"delrioWhatDrivesEcoinnovators2016","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.009","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,20]]},"page":"2158-2170","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What drives eco-innovators?

  {"id":"horbachDigitalisationSustainabilityMeasures2024","abstract":"The paper analyses the “twin transition” of digitalisation and sustainability at the firm level. Operational definitions of digitalisation and sustainability allowing the development of fitting empirical indicators are discussed. The possible technical and social transmission channels of the effects of digitalisation on a sustainable firm development are analysed. Less energy consumption induced by intelligent sensoring systems, the reduction of meetings in presence by video conferences or the promotion of home office work leading to less travel activities may lead to a more sustainable production. Digitalisation might also act as pre-condition of eco-process innovations (e. g. the introduction of intelligent control systems leading to material and energy savings). The empirical analysis is based on firm data of the recent Eurobarometer 486/2020 of the European Commission. The econometric results show that “digitally active” firms seem to be more sustainable for all available indicators, but the marginal effects considerably differ between measures such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, or the use of smart devices and intelligent sensors for the various sustainability-related activities of the firms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Horbach","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"horbachDigitalisationSustainabilityMeasures2024","container-title":"Digital Economy and Sustainable Development","container-title-short":"DESD","DOI":"10.1007/s44265-024-00043-4","ISSN":"2731-9423","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"19","source":"Springer Link","title":"Digitalisation and sustainability measures at the firm level","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s44265-024-00043-4","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"macqDeliberationProductionPublic2020","abstract":"This article investigates how a discourse about the role and value of public participation in science, technology, and innovation emerged and evolved in the research policies of the European Commission. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, two main discourses have been successively institutionalized: the first focused on participation in policy-making, while the second aimed at participation in the production of knowledge and innovation. This paper distinguishes three main institutional phases: (i) a phase dedicated to public participation in the governance of science and technology (2000–2010); (ii) a reframing period of science and technology policies by the Commission to integrate the growing emphasis on innovation (2010–2014); (iii) a period focusing on co-creation and citizen science as new ways to involve the public in science and technology (2014-today). Factors such as individual commitments of key policy actors, specific epistemic communities and institutional dynamics within the Commission played a crucial role in shaping the policies of participation. But broader factors are also essential to account for these changes. In this respect, the economic crisis of the late 2000s appears fundamental to understanding how the conception and promotion of public participation in the European science and technology policies have evolved over time. This paper thus offers new insights to the analysis of the political economy of public participation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Macq","given":"Hadrien"},{"family":"Tancoigne","given":"Élise"},{"family":"Strasser","given":"Bruno J."}],"citation-key":"macqDeliberationProductionPublic2020","container-title":"Minerva","container-title-short":"Minerva","DOI":"10.1007/s11024-020-09405-6","ISSN":"1573-1871","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"489-512","source":"Springer Link","title":"From Deliberation to Production: Public Participation in Science and Technology Policies of the European Commission (1998–2019)","title-short":"From Deliberation to Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-020-09405-6","volume":"58"},

The aim of this study is to investigate the main barriers to MSMEs’ sustainable digital transformation, given their global importance and function as the backbone of any economy. We apply the concept of sustainable digital transformation (SDT), which refers to the process of digitalizing the economy in a long-lasting, green, and organic way by building on its key strength: innovative companies and their business ecosystems. The study is based on a representative survey of 425 Latvian MSMEs, which was conducted in the spring of 2021. We combine a survey of MSMEs with a qualitative comparative analysis. Our study identified seven barriers to sustainable digital transformation for MSMEs, which can be classified into three levels of importance. We found that the most important barriers to MSMEs are IT security issues and the shortage of specialists in the external labor market. Furthermore, we discovered that some barriers differ depending on company attributes, such as the number of employees, revenue, and the ability to implement digital transformation independently. However, the barriers were evaluated similarly by company owners and managers. These findings can help MSMEs’ managers and owners, policymakers, and practitioners understand which barriers are impeding MSMEs’ sustainable digital transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rupeika-Apoga","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Petrovska","given":"Kristine"}],"citation-key":"rupeika-apogaBarriersSustainableDigital2022","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su142013558","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"20","page":"13558","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Barriers to Sustainable Digital Transformation in Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/20/13558","volume":"14"},

Our empirical strategy consists of the estimation of a trivariate probit model. Our results show that those entrepreneurs who give importance to collaboration with research institutes, agencies and universities, and to the increase of market demand for green products are more active in all types of eco-innovations. Supply-side factors seem to be a more important driver for environmental processes and organizational innovations than for environmental product innovations. The results also show that market share only has a significant positive influence on eco-product and eco-organizational innovations, while cost-savings are solely significant for eco-process innovations.
